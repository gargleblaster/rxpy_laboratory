When run with Python 3.6, this program runs as expected without any special handling.

However, when run with Python 3.7, it terminates after all three stocks have
been bought, and all three entryTrigger subscriptions have been unsubscribed.

In order to get it to continue running in Python 3.7, it was necessary to add
the input() call in __main__.  However, that was not enough, because, even
though it would continue to process quotes, it would never sell the stock that
had been bought, because the targetTrigger and stopTrigger subscriptions
apparently had been unsubscribed or terminated, as well.

Actually, as I wrote that, another test was running, and it did sell the stock,
so I'm wondering if there is an issue related to which thread in the pool
actually handles each quote.

I thought that the solution was to add observe_on() to the pipes, but now I'm
not so sure that it was necessary.

I'm still trying to figure this stuff out!
